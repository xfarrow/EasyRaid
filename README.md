# EasyRaid
EasyRaid is a file based Raid1-like application. 

It is useful in those conditions in which:
* A proper Raid 1 is infeasible because of the unrealability of the connection and therefore a desync raid is likely (e.g. non UASP-enabled USB enclosures)
* A Snapraid system requires frequent syncs, meanwhile EasyRaid replicates changes immediately
