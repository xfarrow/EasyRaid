# EasyRaid
EasyRaid is a file based Raid1-like application. 

It is useful in those conditions in which
* A proper Raid 1 is infeasible because of the unrealability of the connection and therefore a desync raid is likely
* Snapraid requires frequent syncs, meanwhile EasyRaid is a real-time application
